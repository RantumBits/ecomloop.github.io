    title: What are PPC services?
  - description: PPC stands for Pay-Per-Click advertising, which is a form of internet marketing that involves purchasing ads from search engines. Search engines like Bing and Google allow advertisers to purchase text ads that are shown in response to certain keywords. This is a popular form of advertising because the advertiser only pays for the search engine ad when an internet user clicks it. SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization, which is the process of marketing a website to increase the number of visitors to the website by improving ranking in web search engine results. SEO takes a few months of research and implementation, but it is an effective long-term strategy.
    title: What is the difference between PPC and SEO?
  - description: While there is no one correct number of PPC campaigns, there is an optimum number that each business should have running. This number varies based on the circumstance, but it's best to have at least two or three different PPC campaigns running at once. It's also best to have different ads for each campaign as well, as it reflects different audiences.
    title: Can you give me an idea of how many PPC campaigns I should have running for my business?
  - description: Retargeting is a strategy for digital marketing that helps brands to target potential customers who have previously visited their website. It consists of advertising a brand’s products or services on the webpages that a user visits after visiting the brand’s site, based on the browser’s cookies. PPC, or pay-per-click, on the other hand, is a form of advertising that costs the advertiser each time a potential customer clicks on their ad.
