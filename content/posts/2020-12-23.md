excerpt:
  We got access to OpenAI and GPT-3 this week. I've had a chance to mess around in the playground, setup a simple API connection, and check out some of the projects other developers are discussing on the Slack group. As I mentioned yesterday, this has me really excited. There's certainly a learning curve to getting most out of the technology.

We got access to OpenAI and GPT-3 this week. I've had a chance to mess around in the playground, setup a simple API connection, and check out some of the projects other developers are discussing on the Slack group. As I mentioned yesterday, this has me really excited. There's certainly a learning curve to getting most out of the technology.

A couple of live projects that have gotten my attention include [copy.ai](https://copy.ai) and [Lavender chrome extension for gmail](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lavender/necbalcggglceeioaehdbkpbldmoabii/related).

After a brief interaction, here's a quick brainstorm on some potential use cases:


- Write descriptions about each shop/business on Emprezzo site
- Create a chatbot for searching the 40,000+ product database
- Write new product descriptions based upon originals
- Train to generate gif patterns from multiple images
- Recommend split tests for email signup offers
- Entice new users with chatbots
- Insert positive messages into mundane tasks
- Find new ecommerces niches for direct to competitor businesses
- Develop new marketing campaigns
- Write enticing, personalized marketing emails
- Provide users with a level of randomness
