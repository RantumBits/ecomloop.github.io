 BookShop.org allows customers to shop from independent bookstores. They take a much smaller cut than other online sellers (i.e. Amazon) and operate as a B Corp supporting public good. I mentioned the site in a recent blog post after hearing about the site on a Reset podcast, where the founder indicated books generally about the same as other online sellers.

Here's more about [BookShop](https://bookshop.org) from the site:

> Bookshop is an online bookstore with a mission to financially support local, independent bookstores.
> We believe that bookstores are essential to a healthy culture. They’re where authors can connect with readers, where we discover new writers, where children get hooked on the thrill of reading that can last a lifetime. They’re also anchors for our downtowns and communities.
> As more and more people buy their books online, we wanted to create an easy, convenient way for you to get your books and support bookstores at the same time.
