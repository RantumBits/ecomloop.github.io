 The launch of a project is generally just the start. Put it out there. Observe and be open to feedback, consider the possibilities, then do it all again. Over time, the product will evolve into something that never could have been conceived from the start.

Digital products are designed to evolve over time. It's rare to get it exactly right the first time and the nature of digital makes evolution inevitable.

When launching a new digital product, there's a desire to make it great from the start. It should function, serve a purpose, and be simple in the beginning. There's no reason to add extra features and plan for every potential scenario at this stage because it's not known how it will be used.

Many new products are used in unexpected ways. Digital products allow for relatively easy modifications to make the product better along the way.

The launch of a project is generally just the start. Put it out there. Observe and be open to feedback, consider the possibilities, then do it all again. Over time, the product will evolve into something that never could have been conceived from the start.
