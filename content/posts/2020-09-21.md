Each day brings new questions of what is the right way to reopen. It's clear the best way is not through *denial of a problem*. Whether it's a 3 year old with a chocolate smeared lip denying taking the treat, or a business claiming COVID is a hoax, the right way forward is by accepting there is a problem.

It's frustrating that businesses have been closed, and the reopening process hasn't been smooth. This isn't due to targeting small businesses, nor due to a hoax. There's a literal global pandemic and the best way to manage is to recognize the problem and respond in a fitting manner. By denying the problem, the issue is only exacerbated.
