 Needless to say, bad systems get bad results. There's no reason to expect the results to get better without systemic changes. Make the systems better, design them for the right results, and keep making them better.

This phrase came up on a recent episode of Dax Shepard's podcast with Dan Heath and was new to me. I listened to this one wife on a family drive to Tahoe last week. She was apparently familiar with the phrase and began reciting it in unison as we listened.

The phrase immediately resonated with me. I spend a lot of my time designing automated systems to help run websites more efficiently. When the right results aren't produced, it's time to look at what's causing the problem. There's no points to denying the problem, blaming the results, or simply trying harder with the same system.

Needless to say, bad systems get bad results. There's no reason to expect the results to get better without systemic changes. Make the systems better, design them for the right results, and keep making them better.
