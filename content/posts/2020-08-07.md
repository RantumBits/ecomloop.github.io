DapperLabs, the makers of the [CryptoKitties](http://www.cryptokitties.co/), recently released crypto collectibles in collaboration with the NBA. NBA TopShot is a new take on classic trading cards, with built-in scarcity for each digital asset. The collectibles take advantage of the digital nature by providing video highlights of specific plays from the 2019-2020 season.

The collectibles are sold in packs, similar to physical trading cards. Admittedly, I was a big trading card collector as a kid and was immediately drawn to this new incarnations as soon as I read about [NBATopShot yesterday on Fred Wilson's blog](https://avc.com/2020/08/nba-top-shot-2/). After buying a pack, I called my seven year son over to help "open" the pack by clicking to reveal each of the digital assets. He immediately was drawn in and we spent the next half hour playing around on the site.

One of the most interesting aspects of NBA TopShot is the built-in marketplace. Each digital asset can be listed on the marketplace, with user-specified prices. Low serial numbers generally list of the highest prices, with specific 'rare' collectibles of the top players being listed for well over $1000 each.

As a Celtics fan, I picked up a Jayson Tatum and Kemba Walker collectible from the marketplace yesterday, and added a Steph Curry that was stuck out as priced too low.

[NBATopShot](https://www.nbatopshot.com/) is invite-only and [invites can be requested via a form provided by DapperLabs](https://dapperlabs.typeform.com/to/bQ4M2EX2). There's certainly more coming on NBATopShot and it's worth checking out now if at all interested in crypto and/or the NBA.
