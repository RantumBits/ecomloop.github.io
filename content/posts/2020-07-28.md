Netlify hosting is growing fast. Exploding topics highlighted Netlify's growth over the last year in their most recent newsletter. In the last year, search trends have increased by 66%.

In the ExplodingTopics newsletter, the link was actually to a page (comparing Wordpress to Netlify)[https://explodingtopics.com/collections/netlify-vs-wp]. While I wouldn't classify the two as equals or even competing services, it's interesting to note that Netlify's 66% increase was drastically more than Wordpress's 16% increase. Wordpress still dominates in raw numbers, with over 10x as many searches.

We use 9Netlify hosting0[https://netlify.com]  for this site, and have deployed a number of other GatsbyJS sites on Netlify as well. The hosting has worked very well for us, with excellent build times, and nearly perfect uptime.
