Search is evolving. Consumers are moving away from direct search by typing into Google. Mobile devices naturally lead to using apps directly for finding results, and many platforms are evolving to include more intent based content to decrease the need for search.

The topic of search has been on my mind over the last 6 weeks while working with Algolia. Here's a few brief notes on ideas that have crossed my mind:

- There are no pure organic search results  
- The best search experiences preclude some level of context, many without direct input
- Grocery stores demonstrate contextual search by grouping items in expected areas. If the items were arranged in alphabetic order, it would be incredibly difficult to find items.
- Intent-based search requires some level of contextual search
- Visual search builds in more context than can possibly be communicated in a search phrase
- An increase in data and information will require more filters and context for optimal results
- All platforms favor own content/products in search results
- Alternative search engines have opportunity to provide better results in specific areas
- Resurgence of email newsletters demonstrates a desire for curation through summary
- Resurgence of email newsletters also demonstrate desire for trusted deep-dive analysis
- All search is biased and consumers appear to be showing a desire to move to trusted sources for some items, while using general social for entertainment
