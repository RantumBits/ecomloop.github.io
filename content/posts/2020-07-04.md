One of the key values of independence is the opportunity to enable the agency of individuals. This Independence Day, there are too many examples of agency being taken away, while hardships are imposed upon the most vulnerable.

The country is not perfect and it must be made better for all - not for a select few. Digital technologies are supposed to enable and equalize. This is far from the case in practice, much as the United States is not truly a land of equal opportunity and justice.

The *ideals* of the country and the digital transformation are far stronger than *reality*. To overcome these challenges, individuals and businesses must both be given the agency to define outcomes, with support to enable success. There's no benefit to artificially holding others back and imposing restrictions.

There is no greatness of which to return. There is the opportunity for improvement ahead.
