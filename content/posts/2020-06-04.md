Fear is palpable everywhere you look. Suburbs have boarded up as if destruction is imminent, governments have imposed curfews, and the looming threat of covid-19 is ever-present. The way forward will not always be easy or smooth. The leaders of tomorrow will not get there by acting fearfully today.

As we transform to a [fully digital economy](https://ecomloop.com/posts/pandemic-will-be-single-biggest-catalyst-in-the-transition-to-digital-commerce/), the leaders of tomorrow will find ways to embrace the problems presented by the present challenges and create new opportunities. Businesses should embrace diversity and equality as a competitive advantage. The best ideas are not generated in a silo. Instead they are developed when a mix of ideas, skills, and perspectives are brought together.

There are too many [broken systems](/posts/fix-the-system-for-better-results/), breeding poor results. The systems can be fixed and made better.

The leaders of tomorrow will embrace the opportunities, find positivity, and step forward with a strategy that works in forward-thinking societal environments.
