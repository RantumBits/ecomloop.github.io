 There's no sense planning for a return to the way things were in 2019. Plan like the future looks more like 2020 than 2019.

---There is no clear end coming to the pandemic. There will not be a moment or day that suddenly reverses all the changes that have occurred. The future is more like the current time than any time in the past. 

We're in the midst of the single biggest catalyst for moving to a digital economy. While many physical businesses are reopening, there's no reason to think the surge in ecommerce spending will suddenly reverse, mass transit will thrive, or travel will snap back. 

Digital commerce is robust and able to both manage and solve many of the problems presented. To do away with the changes entirely, it'd take a denial of the advantages and possibilities presented by technology. There are few cases where humans, in mass, have shunned technology and opted for less convenient methods. It shouldn't be expected now either. 

This isn't to say that people won't shop in local stores, eat locals, travel, or take trains. There are numerous reasons for doing so and some of those numbers will rebound. 

What is less likely is that we entirely do away with the progress made. There's no sense planning for a return to the way things were in 2019. Plan like the future looks more like 2020 than 2019.
