Shopify has a 'lite' plan that enables merchants to take payments and manage stores from the backend, without serving a front end store. This is a great option to consider for utilizing the backend features of Shopify, while serving products to customers in a headless commerce manner, by bringing the transaction to the best place for the specific audience.

The [Shopify Lite plan](https://www.shopify.com/?ref=ecomloop) includes the ability to accept payments by embedding a 'buy button' nearly anywhere. Merchants are also able to send invoices directly to the customer. Since the button can be embedded anywhere, it's also possible to serve a buy / add to cart button via a GatsbyJS site. 

As I've mentioned in the past, [jamstack frameworks like GatsbyJS deliver a faster](https://ecomloop.com/posts/introducing-headless-gatsby-theme-for-shopify/), more secure site to customers and can drastically improve load times. Products are pulled from the Shpoify backed via a private app at the time the site is built, then checkout is handled by Shopify.

On ecommloop, we use Gatsby, along with Shopify Lite to power the ['ecommerce solutions'](https://ecomloop.com/solutions/) portion of our site. This allows us to get the best of Gatsby & Shopify, plus reduces monthly costs when not utilizing the front-end Shopify features.
