Before the pandemic hit, The Lehman Trilogy hit Broadway for a short stint in its United States Debut. Planet Money's Indicator podcast [discussed the play  in a recent episode](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510325/the-indicator-from-planet-money). The play showcases the three Lehman brothers, who founded the infamous financial firm that became one of the larges firms in the world for well over a century, then ultimately collapsed in 2008.

> Just before Broadway shut down, team Indicator saw The Lehman Trilogy, about the origin of Lehman Brothers. We talk with playwright Ben Power about the firm, the family and the consolation of history.

As described in the podcast, the play covers how the company began as a store, accepted non-cash payments, and eventually 'invented' the concept of becoming a middleman. Notably, they begin by accepting and dealing with real goods and assets. Naturally, that becomes unsustainable as the size of the trades increased. Once the brothers began accepting paper rights assigning ownership of the goods, they were able to drastically increase the size of trades.

There's a huge new shift taking place now with digital assets that are even more ephemeral. Rather for standing for physical goods, digital assets are themselves the assets that hold value.
