## How to Improve Your Conversion Rate Optimization

Deciding to launch an ecommerce business is often the easiest part of a new online venture. Figuring out how to grow and increase traffic proves more challenging. However, once you have customers stopping by to browse, how do you get them to convert when research shows that the average ecommerce conversion rates hover around 2%?

You can break free from average sales and focus on conversion rate optimization to improve your results. Here's how to get started.


### Streamline Your Site Design

Distracting sites with clashing colors, different sized fonts, and lack of imagery all lead to lackluster conversions. Your site should focus on a consistent design and color scheme, with four to six colors and up to three fonts throughout your site. From product pages to blog posts, consistency will go a long way to improving your site's overall perception.

The goal is to keep your site clean and easy to read with simple, clear headings that lie above the fold as much as possible. Relying on imagery can also help with the overall aesthetic of your Shopify store.


### Communicate the Problems You're Solving

The products and services you're selling may be obvious, but that doesn't mean customers understand why they need it in the first place. Introduce customers to the problem while focusing on an attractive and clear solution that compels audiences to take action. Product descriptions are one place to start, as well as a value-packed blog or videos that establish you as an expert. The more you can communicate a problem and how much a customer needs your solution, the more likely they are to buy it.


### Optimize Speed

Slow loading sites negatively impact your conversions where customers leave before the page even finishes loading. Consumers expect websites to load in two seconds or less, and some studies show a staggering [25% decrease](https://cxl.com/blog/testing-tools-site-speed/) in conversion rates for just one extra second of load time.

The good news is Shopify's platform is already optimized for speed, but everything you do to your site can drag down how fast it loads. Although there's no singular way to improve your site speed, you can experiment different strategies and A/B test the results. Here's a shortlist of areas to test, remove, or fix to try increasing your speed:



*   Test your installed Shopify apps
*   Remove large, slow-loading images
*   Change your Shopify site theme
*   Reduce redirects
*   Remove videos


### Audit the User Experience from Start to Finish

User experience is everything when it comes to online shopping. Customers expect a seamless, easy, intuitive shopping experience from start to finish. Audit your site by browsing your products and navigate through the customer journey.

Consider the experience with fresh eyes and pay attention to how quickly the site loads, how easy it is to find products, and what the process is like to purchase a product and receive an automatic reply. You can also reach out to a loyal customer and request feedback in exchange for a coupon code or other perk.

If you're lost in the customer journey, a Shopify agency can help identify site speed and user experience issues to optimize your site for higher conversions.

Use a Clear CTA

It can feel uncomfortable asking for a sale or prompting them to sign-up, but customers need a reason to take action. Make it exceedingly clear what a visitor should do on each page from buy now or click to read more about a product. A combination of fonts, design, and pop-ups are all ways to make your CTAs stand-out and spark action.


### Offer Secondary CTAs

We all want customers to buy, but you're leaving money on the table by not offering a secondary CTA option. Give hesitant customers another chance to buy later, or stay in touch for future promotions and product roll-outs. Here are a few ways to create secondary CTAs to convert prospective customers:



*   Free guide
*   Coupon code
*   Email sequence promoting a workshop or challenge
*   Sign-up for your social media channels


### Demonstrate the Value and Benefits

Consumers want products that somehow improve their lives, and it's up to you to demonstrate the value and benefits. Offer real-life examples of what your product or services do and how they impact your target audience. It's okay to add technical details about your products, but they should be less prominent than the benefits to your customer.

It's also easy to confuse the features of a product with the benefits they offer. The features generally describe a product; however, the benefits show the advantages a customer will receive when using your product.


### Install the Right Shopify Apps

The right Shopify apps can make or break your business. Choose the wrong ones, and it could slow down your site and negatively impact site conversions. Focus on the apps that streamline areas like customer service, speed, SEO, image optimization, analytics, and anything else you need to run your ecommerce site effectively. Install one at a time to test if your speed is impacted, or work with a Shopify ecommerce agency to determine which apps work best for your site and business and improve your conversion rate optimization.


### Use Live Chat Software

Catch customers while they're still making up their minds on whether or not to buy. Install a Live Chat app or other software to connect with guests in real-time. Ask if they need help choosing a product or have any questions about the site. The more you can connect personally with customers while removing buying barriers, the more likely they are to buy.


### Allow Customers to Check Out as Guests

Setting up a membership model for your site leads to more reliable income, but can also leave new customers cold. Make sure to allow a guest check-out experience for new customers who want to test drive your products or services. The conversions can be significant. Nearly 23% of users will abandon their shopping cart if they have to create a new user account. Once a guest purchases from you, spend time nurturing the customer relationship to lead them to buy into your membership or a subscription-based business.


### Offer Valuable Content

It’s not unusual for consumers to browse online with absolutely no intention of buying. However, you can keep them interested by offering valuable content. Consider creating:



*   Gift guides
*   Video tutorials
*   Blog posts featuring products
*   Interviews with past customers who solved a problem with your products

The content connects customers with your shop and keeps them coming back for more. Optimized content also helps improve your SEO and increases relevant traffic that is more likely to convert.


### Zero in on Shipping Terms

Shipping still reigns when it comes to online shopping. Outline exactly how much shipping will cost and how long it will take. If possible, give your products a slight mark-up to offer free shipping to stay competitive with major ecommerce players. It's possible free shipping will cut into your profits but is likely worth it for the long-term success of your Shopify store. Research shows that 79% of U.S. consumers said [free shipping](https://www.walkersands.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Walker-Sands_2018-Future-of-Retail-Report.pdf) would make them more likely to shop online.


### Eliminate Payment Concerns

Customers need peace of mind before buying a product that they can't hold or see in person. Remove any payment concerns by outlining a simple return policy and how refunds are processed. You should also offer a variety of secure payment options to impact your conversion rate optimization. Not everyone is comfortable using platforms like PayPal and want to use a credit card. Make sure to offer as many options as possible to remove any hesitations.


### Install Analytics

It's impossible to know how your ecommerce site is doing without studying what’s going on behind the scenes. Install Google Analytics onto your Shopify store to see where customers are coming from, what they're doing online once they get there, and where they're exiting your site. You may discover a spike in traffic to a particular product that no one is buying. Now you can evaluate the copy, images, and price point to improve the results. The more information you have about what your customers are doing, the better equipped you are to increase your conversions dramatically.


### Gather Customer Feedback

Gathering feedback is key to understanding what your customers want, as well as what they like about your products. Send surveys to your customers or ask for honest feedback to make improvements to your store. Asking for feedback also helps retain customers who were lukewarm about buying from your shop again. Once they see you're willing to make changes and offer upcoming enhancements and promotions, they're more likely to return.


### Show Off Reviews

Social proof helps curious browsers convert into paying customers. Research shows that [88% of consumers](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/social-proof-examples) trust user reviews as much as personal recommendations. An app like Shopify Product Reviews allows you to add a customer review feature to your products. You can also use the bulk actions feature to publish, hide, filter, and manage reviews.

Increasing your conversion rate optimization is well within reach with the right strategy in place to see the results you want. Ready to get started? Contact our team of [Shopify ecommerce experts](https://ecomloop.com/solutions/) to discuss your project and explore solutions to get started.
