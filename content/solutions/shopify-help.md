## How to Grow Your Ecommerce Site with Shopify

Shopify is a booming business with impressive gains, even in some of the most challenging economic climates. As of September 2020, Shopify’s first-quarter total revenue was [$470 million](https://news.shopify.com/shopify-announces-first-quarter-2020-financial-results), representing a 47% increase from the comparable quarter in 2019. Shopify store owners report unprecedented growth and share stories of quitting their day jobs and following their dreams. Ecommerce's [share of retail sales](https://ecomloop.com/posts/ecommerce-share-of-retail-sales-will-see-more-growth-in-2020-than-last-3-years/) are also predicted to see more growth in 2020 than the last 3 years.

However, going from zero to profitable is a longer journey than hitting publish and waiting for sales to roll in. Looking to set-up a Shopify store designed to scale? Here's how to get started.


### 1. Setting Up a Shopify Store (and Why There’s More Work to Do)

Setting up a Shopify store is a straight-forward process that can get your business up and running in less than an hour. It's easy to sell the dream of building an ecommerce empire with intuitive platforms and accessible tools. However, there's more to forging a path to success and scale a profitable business.

If you already have a robust following on Instagram or Facebook, your basic Shopify store may be enough to launch into immediate sales. For everyone else, it’s more likely you’ll need to go through some trial and error and brush up on best practices to take your ecommerce presence to the next level.


### 2. Enhance User Experience Focus on User-Friendly Site Design

A user-friendly experience involves quality customer service, an intuitive site design, and an easy navigation process. The stakes are high to get this step right, with up to [88% of online shoppers](https://www.smallbizgenius.net/by-the-numbers/ux-statistics/#gref) declining to return to a website after a poor user experience. There’s also good news for businesses that deliver on a quality experience. Up to 80% of companies who [prioritize customer experience](https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-experience-trends) report an increase in revenue.

Fortunately, you don't need to be a graphic designer to launch a professional-looking ecommerce store that enhances the user experience. Shopify takes the guesswork out of the design process by offering done-for-you templates. However, you’ll still need a sound understanding of site architecture and navigation best practices. You can use Shopify’s tools to create a user experience and test the results, or rely on an ecommerce agency to study the trends, keep up with best practices, and A/B test your site.


### 3. Provide great customer support Enhance Customer Service

Following all of the best practices and enhancing your site like a pro won't resolve a poor customer service experience. Research shows that [49% of American consumers](https://www.vonage.com/resources/articles/the-62-billion-customer-service-scared-away-infographic/) switched companies last year due to poor customer service.

The cornerstones of good customer service include fast delivery, quick resolution to issues, and a reason to come back and purchase more. There are also ways to enhance the overall customer experience and overlap with the user experience we discussed above. Offering store coupons on someone's birthday, following up to ask if they liked the product, or providing an interactive poll to narrow down their product preferences are ways to enhance someone's customer service experience.

### 4. Select and Integrate Your Apps

Shopify is a flexible and nimble platform that allows app integration to enhance your ecommerce store and business. There’s no shortage of Shopify apps that can do everything from help drive traffic to your site to connect your Instagram Feed to your store. You can also pick Shopify apps that allow customers to choose between curbside pickup or local delivery.

Although the thousands of robust Shopify apps are designed to help grow your ecommerce business, it can also be overwhelming knowing what your own site needs. Start by looking through Shopify's Staff Picks or the “What's Trending” area, or you can turn to the experts to determine which apps your store needs from the start. A digital marketing team can choose the most effective apps for your specific business based on data-driven research and monitor your results.

### 5. Improve Optimize Your Shopify Site Store Speed

Site speed is everything when it comes to online business success, and a few extra seconds can dramatically impact your revenue. No one likes slow site speed, and [47% of consumers](https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/site-performance-page-speed-ecommerce) expect a page to load in two seconds or less. You’re also unlikely to gain repeat business, with 79% of customers dissatisfied with a site's performance reporting they’re unlikely to buy from that shop again.

Shopify's self-hosted platform is pretty reliable when it comes to site speed, but there are dozens of ways you could be dragging down your site’s performance:

*   Pop-ups
*   Images
*   Videos
*   Shopify apps
*   Inefficient liquid code
*   Themes

You can monitor some of these issues by using tools like Google Tag Manager. You also don’t need to ditch all your apps and add-ons you’re using to attract a broader audience to your store. You just need to research, monitor and test the results to find the best Shopify apps and tools for your business.


### 6. Optimize on site SEO Create a Content Strategy

Selling products and services on Shopify is rarely a set-it and forget it experience. You still need channels to draw more traffic, convert customers, and keep them coming back. The intersection between marketing and selling is where Shopify owners can create a content strategy.

Depending on your ecommerce niche, there are several ways to create and plan your content, including:

*   Offering free exercise classes to promote your workout gear
*   Start a blog with expert advice that relates to your services
*   Create Instagram Stories that drives engagement and attracts an audience to your shop
*   Launch a podcast to position yourself as a thought leader and drive more awareness to your niche Shopify store
*   Send out periodic newsletters announcing new products and sales

Creating content is a long game that requires diligence and consistency. Setting up a simple calendar and scheduling your content can help reach your content goals and grow your business.


### 7. Build an Email List

Email lists are a powerful way to attract repeat customers to your ecommerce store. There are Shopify apps that integrate email marketing channels, lists, and forms directly into your site. You’ll still need to entice your audience to sign-up for your list. Offering a one-time coupon code or an exclusive sale is one way to capture more emails and stay in touch with your customers.

The frequency, duration, design, and text on your pop-up directly impact how many people will sign-up for your list. It's essential to A/B test your email apps and continually work to improve study the results. You should also monitor your collection forms apps to see how they perform over time, as well as monitor any impacts to your site speed. or any other issues. SYou may find some email management providers may also have difficulty integrating with Shopify’s platform due to restrictions (i.e. Mailchimp requires a third party app).y apps. Regardless, it's essential to A/B test your email apps and continually work to improve the results.


### 8. Test Your Systems and Processes

Gaining momentum and confidence in your Shopify store set-up, user experience, site speed, apps, content strategy, and everything else that goes into a launch isn't the end of the ecommerce journey. Testing your systems and processes through the eyes of a customer is crucial to longevity and success. And then you test them again and again to optimize your state’s performance.

Walk through the entire customer journey and each channel that leads to your Shopify store. Your walk through should also include social media outlets, including browsing your store's Instagram page and clicking through to your products. The idea is to experience precisely what the customer sees from the first click to package or service delivery. You can also recruit beta testers to give honest feedback on the process. The earlier you can uncover bumps in the road, the better.


### 9. Study Your Analytics

Running a Shopify store without understanding your analytics leaves revenue and opportunity on the table. It may be easy to see which products are selling the best, but not understand where those customers are coming from and why they're buying. Your analytics uncovers deep insights into your store, offering a blueprint to enhance your marketing efforts and increase conversions.

Google Analytics integrates into your Shopify store and offers a treasure trove of information, including age, gender, devices, hobbies, and location. Store owners also have access to Shopify analytics that can segment:



*   Sales reports
*   Customer reports
*   Customer reports on everything from taxes to website visitors

The more you study and apply the information from your analytics, the better. It can take some time to master but can help achieve ambitious ecommerce goals with data-driven decision making.


### 10. Scale Your Ecommerce Site

Now that you're all set with your Shopify store, it's time to look at scaling and growing your online presence. Implementing long-term strategies includes studying your conversion rates and figuring out what's working and what's not. That's easier said than done for both newcomers and veterans in the ecommerce space. Best practices and trends are continually evolving.
