  ## Website development promoting Cryptopunks on Billboards

  Worked with a group of Cryptopunks to publish a website in coordination with a billboard event.

  The website is developed on the Gatsby framework and makes use of the Twitter API to pull in recent entries with matching #PunkHunt hashtags.
